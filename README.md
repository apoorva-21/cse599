This is a set of useful scripts and workflows for TAing CSE 599 Teaching Methods in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego.

The following are some of the regular tasks that I am responsible for:

1) Mentor TA recruitment
2) Assigning first-time TAs to mentors
3) Deciding a time for and setting up the Practicum meetings for every group, based on consensus among the mentors and mentees.
4) Managing attendance for all synchronous components*
5) Grading make-up work for missed attendance
6) Managing time log + reflection submissions
7) Tracking student progress and generating reports*

I have outlined my experience and all the helpful advice that I have received from Professor Mia Minnes for each of my responsibilities.
